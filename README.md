# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project was meant to serve as a refresher for myself in the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and to introduce myself to the fundamentals of interacting with Git and GitBash. It also exists as a reminder to take notes frequently, document progress clearly, and not rush through work just because I think I remember how it's meant to go.
